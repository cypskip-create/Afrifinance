 * infer ticker symbols... mark it as unresolved and let the entity-
 * resolution layer handle it." This IS that layer, and it still refuses
 * to guess — an ambiguous or low-confidence match returns null rather
 * than picking the closest one. A wrong company match on a financial
 * announcement is worse than an unresolved one; the former silently
 * corrupts data, the latter is visibly flagged for a human to fix.
