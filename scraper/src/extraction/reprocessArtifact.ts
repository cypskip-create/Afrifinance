/**
 * Reprocessing (§45): re-run extraction against an already-stored
 * artifact using the CURRENT parser code, without re-downloading. Useful
 * after fixing a bug in extraction logic (exactly the kind of bug this
 * project has hit repeatedly — the pdf.js DataCloneError, the gzip
 * decompression issue, the table-heuristic false positives) — those
 * fixes only help documents crawled AFTER the fix unless there's a way
 * to reprocess what's already stored.
 *
 * Always inserts a NEW extraction row (insertExtraction never updates in
 * place — see that module's comment) so the old, buggy extraction stays
 * visible for comparison rather than silently vanishing.
 *
 * The actual per-content-type extraction work lives in
 * extractByContentType.ts, shared with extractionSweep.ts — this module
 * is just "look up one named artifact, extract it, insert the row".
