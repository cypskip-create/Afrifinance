/**
 * Per-hostname rate limiting (§20 — "do not hammer websites", per-domain
 * limits). Single in-memory map keyed by hostname — sufficient for a
 * single-instance service; if this ever needs to run as multiple
 * replicas, this needs to move to Redis (matching the note in db.ts
 * about ADAPTER_MODE and Redis being deferred until actually needed).
 *
 * This is intentionally simple: track the last request timestamp per
 * host, and if a new request arrives before the minimum interval has
 * elapsed, wait out the remainder. Not a true token bucket (no burst
 * allowance) — for a crawler that's a feature, not a limitation: bursts
 * are exactly what §20 asks to avoid.
